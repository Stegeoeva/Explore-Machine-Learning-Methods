# Regression Project

The main objective of this work is to analyse and evaluate in detail various regression methods, such as the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), the Ridge and LASSO regression methods.

These methods are combined in turn with resampling techniques, such as cross validation.

A further objective is to familiarise with evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). 

Deal with the hyperparameters that define a Machine learning problem, such as the normalization weight and the degree of polynomial correlation. 

Of particular importance in the measurement and selection of the values of the hyperparameters is the avoidance of overfitting the model.
